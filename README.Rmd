```{r echo=FALSE, message=F, warning=F}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)

df = read_csv("Data.csv") %>% 
  gather(Player, Guess, -Character, -Actual) %>% 
  mutate(Score = ifelse(Actual == Guess, 1, 0),
         # assessing if it's a white walker guess, then it's worth 2
         Score = ifelse(Actual == "White Walker" & Guess == "White Walker", 2, Score))

df %>% 
  group_by(Player) %>% 
  summarise(Score = sum(Score, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Score)) %>% 
  kable
